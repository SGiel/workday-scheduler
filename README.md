# Stephanie's Workday Scheduler

## Description 

This web application is a daily planner to schedule out the day. When it is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When the user scrolls down there are time blocks for standard business hours. When viewing the schedule, each time-block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future.

When the user clicks on a time block, they can enter an event. Entering events in time blocks already passed for the day are allowed, as it is assumed the user is creating a schedule that can be used for the work day with recurring events each day. A listing of events with the return or enter key are allowed in the time block. 

The user clicks the save button for that time block to save the event. When the page is refreshed the saved events remain on the schedule. The page is refreshed every 15 minutes so that past/present/future events will update their visual effects

This JavaScript code contains skills I recently learned including accessing localStorage to save and retrieve date, using jQuery to listen for events, using Bootstrap grid to lay out the schedule, using awesomefonts to grab an icon and using momentjs to manipulate times.

## Screenshots of web application when I first completed it (and had even completed this README.md). When I was going over the challenge in Canvas right before I was to turn it in, I saw that the mock-up was not just a picture of the welcome screen of the test, but a video rotating through the other screens. I included them, because I put a lot of time into re-working the entire challenge and just had to mention it!
